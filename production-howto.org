
* TODO next time try recording at 30fps in obs.

* recording checklist
** OBS
- [ ] studio mode off
- [ ] make sure (settings -> audio -> devices -> mic ) is set to turtle beach
      Refresh in device manager if it doesn't show up.
** j windows
- [ ] preztool should take care af most of this
- [ ] run finished example app
- [ ] then 'c' to clear environment
- [ ] have autohotkey scripts running (tools/viewmat.ahk) if necessary
** microphone
- [ ] green setting


* editing in blender
edit -> preferences -> system -> sequencer cache  = 4096
lower left hand corner in timeline: playback -> top dropdown = av sync

** usage notes
- New / Video Editing
- frame count starts at 1 (not 0)
- "K" cuts clips at the playhead...
- Make sure audio is good volume before you start cutting.
- To batch-edit a property (e.g. volume) on clips later:
  - select them (ctrl-L selects long chains of adjacent clips)
  - set the property on one, then right click the property and "copy to selected"
- ctrl-home / ctrl-end mark current frame as start/end of render

Blender 2.8 seems to have a bug once you cut out some audio and try to remove gaps - suddenly the video and audio fail to line up even with av sync on, and to fix it you have restart blender.

So: I tend to make my cuts, delete the parts i don't want (ums and errs and whatnot) then position the cursor at the start of the video, select all, and press backspace to remove all the gaps at once for a segment of the video. Then I save and restart blender.

actually: selecting the moved strips and toggling mute/unmute (h / alt-h) fixes the problem.
there's already a fix for this in the blender repo https://developer.blender.org/D5391



** converting from phone video
- convert footage to "youtube for hd" avi at 60fps
- make sure render output in blender is 60fps
- and also frame step = 1 (else it'll drop frames)

** rendering to video
- output panel in the properties / scene / output panel
- format: ffmpeg
- container: matroska
- what i did for s1e0
  - video settings:
    - codec: h.264
    - quality: high
    - audio code
  - audio settings:
    - mp3 / bitrate=192

- people complained they couldn't hear the audio, so for s1e1 i used aac with bitrate = 192
- setting output directory to // puts it in same dir as the current file  (d:/videos/j-talks/xxx)
- [ ] youtube recommendations https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en
    - container: mp4
    - audio codec: aac-lc stereo; sample rate: 96khz or 48khz
    - video codec: H.264

* publishing on youtube
- switch to tangentstorm account
- add to 'j demos' playlist
- link to gist with finished code

* marketing checklist
- reddit.com/r/apljk
- j programming forum
- twitter

* hardware used
logitech hd 1080p camera
turtle beach streaming mic
  - green setting (cardiod - usually best for streaming)
  - orange setting (hypercardioid - better for noisier room)

not sure about model numbers

* software used
- emacs org-mode for scripts
- OBS Studio
- J
- Blender


* color scheme

desktop background: #001824
background colors: 122c3d 003a61 00538a 0071bd 3c90c8


* TODO blender color management:
: output -> color management -> transform -> default
prevents blender from changing the colors!


* blender notes
blender: apply transform to bake transforms into the actual geometry
set orign from object -> set origin -> orgin to geometry
